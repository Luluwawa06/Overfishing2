		<h2 class="header">Causes</h2>
		
		<h3 class="subtitle">The increasing Demand</h3>
		<p class="textcause">Over the past couple decades the global population has been rapidly increasing. The main cause of this is the evolution of health care. Now we are almost 8 billion human beings on this planet. </p>


		<h3 class="subtitle2">The bad managment </h3>
		<p class="textcause2">Overfishing occurs when more fish are caught then are able to reproduce to repopulate. Often in MEDC's the fish industry is badly managed, the governement try to improve it's economy by lettting theit fisherman fish as much as they want. and therfor the fish population doesn't have time to repopulate.</p>

		<h3 class="subtitle3">Illegal fishing </h3>
		<p class="textcause3">Illegal fishing is more common than we think it is. Sometimes fisherman's lies about the type of fish that they cathed witch of course makes a big problem for the monitoring.<br>Than we have a second problem fishing in international waters because these waters don't belong too any country it is barely regulated</p>
