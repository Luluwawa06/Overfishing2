		<h2 class="header">Effects</h2>

		<h3 class="subtitle"> Marine Ecosystem Imbalance</h3>
		<p class="textcause">The essential predator are also impacted because their supply of food is smaller. The decreasing amount of fish leeds also to the increasing growth of algae that can grow as it want without any natural predators.</p>

		<h3 class="subtitle2">The increasing price </h3>
		<p class="textcause2">Because the fish reserves will diminish, but the demand won't, the price of fish will rise. For places like Europe and the U.S it won't be such an issue because the general public is rich in comparaison to Africa, South America and parts of Asia. This may lead to hunger because despite the apparences for a lot of poeple the main source of food are fishes.</p>

		<h3 class="subtitle3">The bottom of the oceans</h3>
		<p class="textcause3">New fishing techniques use enormous nets too catch a lot of fish at a time. But these nets are so long that the bottom of the oceans gets absolutely destroyed by it. That means that a lot of sea life dies because of this. The main victim of this technique are corals.</p>
